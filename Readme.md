# Connect 4 Game

This is a web-based implementation of the classic Connect 4 game. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 6x7 grid.
- Two players take turns to drop their colored discs into a column.
- The first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of their own discs wins.
- The game ends when a player wins or when the board is full.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click on any column to drop your disc into that column.
3. The game will automatically switch turns between the red player and the yellow player.
4. The game will announce the winner once a player connects four discs in a row.
